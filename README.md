##Connect Four

This is a command line based version of the popular game 'Connect Four'.  Since this is only playable on an ANSI console, there are no colors to match the originals.  Instead, the human player will use tiles denoted by "X" and the computer will use tiles denoted by "O"

As a quick reminder of the rules, each player drops a tile in the column of their choice.  The first person to arrange their tiles four in a row - be it vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in any direction is the winner.
